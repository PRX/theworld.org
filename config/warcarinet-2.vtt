1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.109
<v Speaker 1>In Jerusalem.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.879
<v Speaker 1>A committee meeting in the Knesset,

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.619
<v Speaker 1>Israel's parliament, was disrupted

4
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.879
<v Speaker 1>by protesters.

5
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.769
<v Speaker 1>They included relatives of Israelis

6
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.509
<v Speaker 1>still being held hostage in the Gaza

7
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Strip.

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.259
<v Speaker 1>One man pushed his way inside the

9
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.149
<v Speaker 1>room and yelled, it can't go on

10
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.829
<v Speaker 1>like this at lawmakers.

11
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.119
<v Speaker 1>You won't sit here while our

12
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.099
<v Speaker 1>children die over there.

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.659
<v Speaker 1>The relatives of the remaining 100

14
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.759
<v Speaker 1>plus hostages have become a powerful

15
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.649
<v Speaker 1>pressure group in Israel.

16
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.029
<v Speaker 1>They're fearful that the Israeli

17
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.619
<v Speaker 1>authorities are not doing enough to

18
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.059
<v Speaker 1>bring them home.

19
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.619
<v Speaker 1>Last month, Israeli troops

20
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.329
<v Speaker 1>accidentally shot and killed three

21
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.739
<v Speaker 1>hostages in Gaza.

22
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.329
<v Speaker 1>Since then, officials have signaled

23
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.219
<v Speaker 1>a shift in strategy, but it's

24
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>unclear what exactly that means.

25
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.159
<v Speaker 1>Israeli troops continue to push into

26
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.869
<v Speaker 1>the southern Gaza city of Khan

27
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.369
<v Speaker 1>Yunis, but the high ranking

28
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.719
<v Speaker 1>officials who make up the country's

29
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.549
<v Speaker 1>war cabinet appear to be more

30
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.929
<v Speaker 1>divided than ever.

31
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.399
<v Speaker 1>To understand all of this, we called

32
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.359
<v Speaker 1>Ehud Aron.

33
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.799
<v Speaker 1>He was a foreign policy aide to

34
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.899
<v Speaker 1>former Prime Minister Ehud Barak,

35
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.399
<v Speaker 1>and he is an assistant professor in

36
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.139
<v Speaker 1>international relations at Haifa

37
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.609
<v Speaker 1>University.

38
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.469
<v Speaker 1>Interrupting a committee meeting in

39
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.419
<v Speaker 1>parliament seems quite bold.

40
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.639
<v Speaker 1>How much support does this protest

41
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.349
<v Speaker 1>movement have in Israel?

42
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.119
<v Speaker 2>I think they have some support.

43
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.499
<v Speaker 2>You know, all Israelis, I guess, are

44
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.449
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic to the situation but are

45
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.759
<v Speaker 2>divided on what needs to be done.

46
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.319
<v Speaker 2>People who are closer to the current

47
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.449
<v Speaker 2>government or supported prefer

48
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.299
<v Speaker 2>to go ahead with the military

49
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.159
<v Speaker 2>operation in Gaza, even if it means,

50
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.049
<v Speaker 2>in practice, leaving the hostages,

51
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.359
<v Speaker 2>you know, in Hamas jails.

52
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.889
<v Speaker 1>So so the people who have been

53
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.749
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating for the

54
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.819
<v Speaker 1>hostages to come home, how exactly

55
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.019
<v Speaker 1>do they want the government or

56
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.489
<v Speaker 1>military to make that happen?

57
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.779
<v Speaker 2>They want the government to reach an

58
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.249
<v Speaker 2>agreement with Hamas.

59
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.199
<v Speaker 2>One problem with that is that

60
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.669
<v Speaker 2>it would probably place severe

61
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.499
<v Speaker 2>limitations on Israel's ability

62
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.329
<v Speaker 2>to operate militarily in

63
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.349
<v Speaker 2>Gaza.

64
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.059
<v Speaker 1>So it's seen as an either or bring

65
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.069
<v Speaker 1>the hostages home or continue

66
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.389
<v Speaker 1>the campaign against Hamas.

67
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.369
<v Speaker 2>Yes, it is in fact the military

68
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.659
<v Speaker 2>pressure that can release the

69
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.619
<v Speaker 2>hostages.

70
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.359
<v Speaker 2>Most commentators, and definitely

71
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.189
<v Speaker 2>the families, feel that it is

72
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.769
<v Speaker 2>indeed an either or situation.

73
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.449
<v Speaker 1>The Israeli government says that

74
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.219
<v Speaker 1>it's shifting to a less intense

75
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.199
<v Speaker 1>offensive strategy in Gaza.

76
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.819
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?

77
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.649
<v Speaker 2>It means stopping what is called

78
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.479
<v Speaker 2>an Israeli maneuver, moving

79
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.129
<v Speaker 2>quickly and trying to capture more

80
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.259
<v Speaker 2>territory, holding the positions

81
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.119
<v Speaker 2>as they are now, and

82
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.189
<v Speaker 2>conducting raids on

83
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.139
<v Speaker 2>some targets in southern Gaza.

84
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.879
<v Speaker 2>Like the operation that's unfolding

85
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.469
<v Speaker 2>in Honduras.

86
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.909
<v Speaker 1>I want to I want to ask you now

87
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.409
<v Speaker 1>about the War Cabinet that Prime

88
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.299
<v Speaker 1>Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created

89
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.189
<v Speaker 1>after the October 7th attack

90
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.799
<v Speaker 1>to manage this campaign in Gaza.

91
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.899
<v Speaker 1>One of its members, Gadi Eisenkot,

92
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.099
<v Speaker 1>has been speaking out about the

93
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.379
<v Speaker 1>divisions inside of the War Cabinet.

94
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.419
<v Speaker 1>He's a former IDF chief of staff,

95
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.369
<v Speaker 1>and his son and his nephew

96
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.539
<v Speaker 1>have died in this war.

97
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.519
<v Speaker 1>What has he been saying?

98
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.779
<v Speaker 2>So he's somewhat surprised.

99
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.489
<v Speaker 2>The public, in a very candid

100
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.409
<v Speaker 2>interview in which he said we

101
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.999
<v Speaker 2>should bring the hostages back

102
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.069
<v Speaker 2>first. This is coupled with leaks

103
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.079
<v Speaker 2>from the cabinet, probably from him,

104
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.209
<v Speaker 2>that he's extending the war

105
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.849
<v Speaker 2>to a serious political force.

106
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.769
<v Speaker 1>Um, Eisenkot has called

107
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.629
<v Speaker 1>for elections, which

108
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.339
<v Speaker 1>in Israel's system requires a

109
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.169
<v Speaker 1>majority vote in the Knesset to

110
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.099
<v Speaker 1>to trigger.

111
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.169
<v Speaker 1>Um. Is that more likely now

112
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.059
<v Speaker 1>than in the past because of, I don't

113
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.039
<v Speaker 1>know, this protest movement or these

114
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.449
<v Speaker 1>emerging rifts within the war

115
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.199
<v Speaker 1>cabinet.

116
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.609
<v Speaker 2>The war in general is a huge

117
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.259
<v Speaker 2>political risk from Netanyahu.

118
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.419
<v Speaker 2>Israel's government's failure

119
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.909
<v Speaker 2>to defend its citizens who respond

120
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.949
<v Speaker 2>effectively after the attacks,

121
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.539
<v Speaker 2>are all reasons that would lead you

122
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.429
<v Speaker 2>to believe that there should be

123
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.049
<v Speaker 2>political instability.

124
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.939
<v Speaker 2>But Netanyahu still has a very

125
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.709
<v Speaker 2>strong, tight coalition.

126
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.539
<v Speaker 2>So this is not the immediate

127
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.429
<v Speaker 2>end of the Netanyahu government.

128
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.839
<v Speaker 1>So you're not anticipating an

129
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.119
<v Speaker 1>election being called anytime soon?

130
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.699
<v Speaker 2>Not in the immediate future.

131
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.759
<v Speaker 1>So so if leadership did change

132
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.289
<v Speaker 1>during the war, and, for example,

133
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.909
<v Speaker 1>Benny Gantz, one of the ministers in

134
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.229
<v Speaker 1>the war cabinet who's, you know,

135
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.849
<v Speaker 1>also the leader of a of another

136
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.739
<v Speaker 1>party, you think that

137
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.929
<v Speaker 1>the war would come to an end?

138
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.819
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say, but

139
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.069
<v Speaker 2>I think the chances will be higher

140
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.109
<v Speaker 2>that it will end, or at least

141
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.179
<v Speaker 2>will have clearer goals with a clear

142
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.939
<v Speaker 2>timeline and an exit strategy.

143
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.769
<v Speaker 2>Because guns in Eisenkot

144
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.689
<v Speaker 2>to his partner are much more open

145
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.609
<v Speaker 2>to the political process compared

146
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.689
<v Speaker 2>to Netanyahu.

147
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.099
<v Speaker 1>How have you been feeling watching

148
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.469
<v Speaker 1>those divisions start to emerge?

149
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.969
<v Speaker 2>I generally think it's a positive

150
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.559
<v Speaker 2>thing, especially during times of

151
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.389
<v Speaker 2>war. Multiplicity of voices

152
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.619
<v Speaker 2>and people who challenge the

153
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.539
<v Speaker 2>mainstream are important.

154
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.029
<v Speaker 2>The government, in my view, did not

155
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.549
<v Speaker 2>set realistic world war aims

156
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.139
<v Speaker 2>and did not include the political

157
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.609
<v Speaker 2>process with the Palestinians or

158
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.349
<v Speaker 2>political goal at the end.

159
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.389
<v Speaker 1>Ehud Iran was a foreign policy

160
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.159
<v Speaker 1>aide to former Prime Minister Ehud

161
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.319
<v Speaker 1>Barak, and is an associate professor

162
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.179
<v Speaker 1>in international relations at Haifa

163
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.859
<v Speaker 1>University in Israel.

164
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.679
<v Speaker 1>Ehud. Thank you.

165
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.729
<v Speaker 1>So much.

166
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.229
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for inviting me.

167
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Take care.
